# ReVoice  

**ReVoice** is an end-to-end voice conversion system designed to enhance accessibility and usability through seamless integration of speech-to-text transcription and text-to-speech synthesis. This project combines state-of-the-art machine learning models to process audio input and generate high-quality, natural-sounding speech output.  

### Key Features  
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper model for accurate and efficient transcription of audio files into text.  
- **Text-to-Speech Synthesis**: Leverages Tacotron2 for mel-spectrogram generation and HiFi-GAN for realistic speech waveform synthesis.  

### Tech Stack  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries and Tools**: Transformers, Librosa, SpeechBrain, PyTorch
